## An Individual Neuron
Neurons are the basic cell type of the nervous system.

There are 100 billion or so in our brains.

Neurons talk to one another. They cause one another to get excited.

### Parts of a Neuron
+ Dendrites - Receive the information.
+ Soma (or cell body) - Contains the nucleus.
+ Axon - Wire sending information onwards.
+ Axon Hillock - Boundary that must be passed for neuron to fire.
    
### Process
1. Neuron gets an exciting signal from previous neuron at the end of one dendritic fiber.
2. Channels in the membrane in the dendrite open.
3. Allowing various ions to flow in and others out.
4. Resulting in the inside of the dendrite becoming more positively charged.

### The Resting Potential.
Neurons are all about contrasts. They must be either completely on or off.

"I have nothing to say" state not neutrally charged,
Instead the inside of the neuron is negatively charged.

This makes for a very dramatic contrast. No neuron will ever confuse the two.

The internally negative state is called the "Resting Potential".

### Action Potential
If a single dendritic fibril is excited, that's not enough to pass on the excitation down to the axonal end.

If the resting potential around the axon 'hillock' moves from -70mv to -40mv a threshold is passed.

Once that happens all hell breaks loose.
A different class of channels open in the membrane of the hillock.
This allows a massive migration of ions producing, finally, a positive +30mV charge.

This "myelination" causes the action potential to shoot down the axon faster.

The threshold of the axon hillock can change over time, thus changing the neurons excitability.

### Information Signalling
A neuron has two different types of signaling systems.

1. From the dendritic spines to the start of the axon hillock it's an analogue signal with gradations that dissapate over time.
2. From the axon hillock to the axon terminals, it's a digital system with all-or-nothing signaling.

There is an insulation of glial cells that wrap around an axon called a myelin sheath.

## Synpatic Communication (Two Neurons)

The "Neuron Doctrine" - idea that there is a tiny gap between neurons.

The gaps are called synapses.

The electrical signal doesn't leap across the gap. Instead it gets translated into a different type of signal.

## Neurotransmitters
Inside each axon terminal there are little balloons called vesicles filled with many copies of a chemical messenger.





## Glia Cells
There are 10 glial cells for every neuron!

Classic Story (Glia cells as gofers):
+ Provide structural support and insulation for neurons.
+ Store energy for them and help to mop up neuronal damage.

Actually:
+ Greatly influence how neurons speak to one another.
+ Form glial networks that communicate completely differently to neurons.

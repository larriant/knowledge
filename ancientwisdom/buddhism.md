# Buddhism
There are 3 fundamental beliefs of buddhism.

## 1. Suffering *Dukkha*

Existence involves "unsatisfactoriness, suffering and pain".

This suffering occurs because:
* we *crave* for things that we don't have.
* we are *aversive* to mental and physical pain.

## 2. Impermanence *Annica*
All things are in a constant state of flux.

+ thoughts rise and then fall away.
+ the body is constantly changeing.

## 3. No-Self *Anatta*

There is no unchanging, permanent self or soul in living beings.

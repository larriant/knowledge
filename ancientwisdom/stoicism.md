# Stoicism

What is the aim of Roman Stoicism?

* to live a life of **tranquility**.

What is tranquility?

* absence of negative emotions such as grief, anger and anxiety.
* presence of positive emotions such as joy.

## Stoic Practices

### 1. Distinguish between the Trichotomy of Control

The Trichotomy of control says that everything in our mental lives fits into one of three categories:

1. Things we have complete control over
   1. The goals that we set ourselves.
   2. The values that we give ourselves.
   3. The character that we build.
2. Things we have no control over
   1. The sun rising tomorrow.
   2. The plane crashing
   3. My eventual death.
3. Things we have partial control over
   1. A tennis match
   2. The love of a partner.

Stoicism says 

* We should try to concern ourselves primarily with things we \*can\* control.
* And avoid dwelling on things we cannot control.

### 2. Negative Visualisation

Imagining that the things you value in life are taken away from you.

### Types

* Loss of your relationships \(Death of Friends, Family, Lovers\)
* Loss of your possessions \(House, Car, Clothes, Food\)
* Loss of your life \(Cancer + only 2 weeks to live\)

### Benefits

1. Allows you to avoid hedonic adaption
2. Ability to deal with losses that DO happen in your life
3. Allows you to feel joy and more enjoyment of the things you do have

Hedonic Adaption - Process of getting used to a situation

A stoic looks at a glass and thinks how amazing it is that it exists,  
how useful the glass is, and the effort that went into making it.

### Possible Habits

1. When you meet / say goodbye to someone
   1. Think that it might be the last time that you see them
2. Before you eat - remind yourself how lucky you are to eat
   1. Think how lucky you are to have food

### 3. Self Restraint

Trying to maximise comfort leads to LESS comfort.

So:

* As well as contemplating bad things happening.
* We should also sometimes live as if they had happened.

For Example : Practice Poverty

* Allow us to realise the things we could live without.
* Often we work hard to obtain things that we could live without.

### WHY?

1. To harden ourselves against future misfortune.
2. Less anxiety because you know you can deal with less.
3. Helps us to appreciate what we already have.

Willpower is like muscle power: it can be trained.

### Ideas

1. Fasting
2. Cold Showering
3. Roughest Dress
4. Sleep on Floor

When practicing self restraint: Feel pleased and proud of yourself.  
Always try to engage in a Cost Benefit Analysis of Pleasure

### 4. Set Internal Goals

Stoics will set internal rather than external goals.

Goal in Tennis Match

* To play tennis to the best of my ability
* RATHER than to win at all costs

Wife: To behave in a lovable manner.  
Boss: To do my job to the best of my ability.

A novelist trying to get published.

* Did I work hard? Did I submit to enough publishers?
* RATHER than I must get published at all costs

Trying to get a girlfriend

* Approach / Talk to x girls per week.
* RATHER than I have to get a girlfriend at all costs.

### Stoic Checklist

Am I practicing the psychological techniques of stoicism?

1. Have I engaged in negative visualizations?
2. Did I distinguish between the things I have control over and those I don't.
3. Did I internalize my goals?
4. Did I refrain from dwelling in the past?
5. Did I consciously practice acts of self-denial

1. Stop Blaming, Censuring and Praising Others.
2. Stop Boasting about ourselves and how much we know.

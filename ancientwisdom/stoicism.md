# Stoicism

What is the aim of Roman Stoicism?

* to live a life of **tranquility**.

What is tranquility?

* absence of negative emotions such as grief, anger and anxiety.
* presence of positive emotions such as joy.

## Stoic Practices

### 1. Distinguish between the Trichotomy of Control

The _Trichotomy of Control_ says that everything in our mental lives fits into one of three categories:

1. Things we have complete control over
   1. The goals that we set ourselves.
   2. The values that we give ourselves.
   3. The character that we build.

2. Things we have no control over
   1. The sun rising tomorrow.
   2. The plane crashing
   3. My eventual death.

3. Things we have partial control over
   1. A tennis match
   2. The love of a partner.

Stoicism says

* We should try to concern ourselves primarily with things we \*can\* control.
* And avoid dwelling on things we cannot control.

### 2. Practice Negative Visualisation

Imagining that the things you value in life are taken away from you.

#### Types

* Loss of your relationships \(Death of Friends, Family, Lovers\)
* Loss of your possessions \(House, Car, Clothes, Food\)
* Loss of your life \(Cancer + only 2 weeks to live\)

#### Benefits

1. Allows you to avoid hedonic adaption.
   1. This is the process of getting used to our life circumstances.
   2. They no longer give us joy because they've become routine.
2. Ability to deal with losses that **DO** happen in your life.
3. Allows you to feel joy and more enjoyment of the things you do have.

A stoic looks at a glass and thinks how amazing it is that it exists,  
how useful the glass is, and the effort that went into making it.

#### Possible Habits

1. When you meet / say goodbye to someone
   1. Think that it might be the last time that you see them
2. Before you eat - remind yourself how lucky you are to eat
   1. Think how lucky you are to have food

### 3. Practice Self Restraint

Trying to maximise comfort leads to LESS comfort.

So:

* As well as contemplating bad things happening.
* We should also sometimes live as if they had happened.

For Example : Practice Poverty

* Allow us to realise the things we could live without.
* Often we work hard to obtain things that we could live without.

#### WHY?

1. To harden ourselves against future misfortune.
2. Less anxiety because you know you can deal with less.
3. Helps us to appreciate what we already have.

Willpower is like muscle power: it can be trained.

#### Ideas

1. Fasting
2. Cold Showering
3. Roughest Dress
4. Sleep on Floor

When practicing self restraint: Feel pleased and proud of yourself.  
Always try to engage in a Cost Benefit Analysis of Pleasure

### 4. Set Internal Goals

We have a choice in life: to concern ourselves with things external or things internal.

A stoic will look for all benefit and harm to come from within himself.

It is best to want those things that are easy to obtain.  
Ideally only want things that you can be certain of obtaining.

Your primary desire should be:  
Not to be frustrated by forming desires you will not be able to fulfill.

Thus:  
1. No anxiety about whether you will get what you want.  
2. No disappointment at NOT getting what you want.

Even if we succeed in something that is not up to us.  
We will still be anxious on the way.

#### Examples of Internal over External Goals

1. Goal in Tennis Match:
   1. To play tennis to the best of my ability.
   2. **Rather** than to win at all costs.

2. Wife:
   1. To behave in a lovable manner.
   2. **Rather** than "My husband must do x"  

3. Boss:
   1. To do my job to the best of my ability.
   2. **Rather** than "I must succeed"

4. A novelist trying to get published:
   1. Did I work hard? Did I submit to enough publishers?
   2. **Rather** than I must get published at all costs

5. Trying to get a girlfriend:
   1. Approach / Talk to x girls per week.
   2. **Rather** than I have to get a girlfriend at all costs.

### 5. Don't Dwell on the Past

To avoid dwelling on the past we should take on a fatalist attitude.

* Fatalist Attitude - We cannot choose our role in the play of life.

* Amor Fati - We should welcome whatever happens to us with open arms.

#### Fatalism about the Past

Keep firmly in mind that the past cannot be changed.  
Learn to be happy with whatever we got.

We should think about the past but only to learn so we do better in  
the future.

#### Fatalism about the Present

We have a choice:

* Either spend time wishing the present was different.
* Or embracing the present.

Mirror Image of Negative Visualization

* Refusing to think about how our present situation could be different.

**However** we should strive to become better people.

* To practice stoicism in our lives.
* And strive to do our social duty.

## Stoic Checklist

Am I practicing the psychological techniques of stoicism?

1. Have I engaged in negative visualizations?
2. Did I distinguish between the things I have control over and those I don't.
3. Did I internalize my goals?
4. Did I refrain from dwelling in the past?
5. Did I consciously practice acts of self-denial

## Judging our Stoicness - Signs of Progress

1. Stop Blaming, Censuring and Praising Others.
2. Stop Boasting about ourselves and how much we know.
3. Should have fewer desires than before.
4. Our philosophy will consist of actions rather than words.
   1. You don't need to tell everyone your philosophy
   2. Be so inconspicuous that they don't even label us a stoics
5. Should have fewer negative thoughts.
6. Should spend less time wishing things could be different.
7. More outbursts of Joy!

### Stoic Advice for Social Relations

Other people:

* Give us some of the best things in life: Love and Friendship.
* But also are the cause of most of our negative emotions.

Stoics feel like they have a **duty** to form and maintain relationships.  
For it is for this that they were created.

However. We can be selective about who we befriend.  
We should seek friends who share our values.  
Or ideally are doing a better job of living stoically than we are.

Vices are contageous. Avoid spending time with such people.

The Astonishing Hypothesis (Materialism):
> "You", your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.'

2. Mind-Brain connection.

Existence Proof: Physical objects can do complex things. Machines can play chess.

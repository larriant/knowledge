# Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
## What is Cognitive Therapy?
1. The first principle of cognitive therapy is that all your moods are created by your ‘cognitions’, or thoughts.

2. The second principle is that when you are feeling depressed, your thoughts are dominated by a pervasive negativity.

3. The third principle is that the negative thoughts which cause your emotional turmoil nearly always contain gross distortions.

## What are the gross distortions?
### 1. All or Nothing thinking
The tendency to think in terms of false dichotomies.
You're either on top of the world OR down in the depths of despair.

Example: "I got laid off. I'm a total loser".

Solution: There are no absolutes in life.

### 2. Over generalization
You conclude that one thing that's happened to you will continue to happen again and again.

Example: "Why does this always happen to me".

Solution: Stop saying "always", "every" and "never". Really never?

### 3. Mental Filter
Involves focusing entirely on the negative aspects of a situation while excluding the positive.

Example: After a good presentation someone gives a little bit of critical feedback.

Solution: Ask yourself "What's great about this problem?"

### 4. Disqualifying the Positive
Involves transforming all neutral or positive experiences into negative ones.
Example: After acing an interview you say: "Oh it was nothing really"

Solution: Cultivate an attitude of gratitude.

### 5. Jumping to Conclusions
You jump to negative conclusions with little or no evidence.

a) Mind Reading
You assume that you know what someone else is thinking.

Example: "She's gossiping about me. I know it!"

b) Fortune Telling
Tendency to arbitrarily predict the future negatively.

Example: "I just know I'm going to flunk my interview today"

### 6. Magnification (catastrophizing)
Occurs when you look at your own errors and exaggerate their importance.

Example: "I can't believe I said that. My life is over."

Solution: Be mindful of the language you use to describe events.

### 7. Minimization
You inappropriately shrink things like your own desirable qualities until they appear tiny.

Example: "I'm not that good at my life"

### 8. Emotional Reasoning
When we take our emotions as evidence for the truth.

Example: "I feel worthless, therefore I am worthless".

### 9. Should Statements
This is when you have ironclad rules for how you or others should behave.

Example: “People ought to call ahead when they’re running late.”

### 10. Labeling and Mislabeling
When you describe an event using words that are highly colored and emotionally charged.

Example: “I ate too much dessert. I feel like a disgusting pig.”

### 11. Personalization
Personalization occurs when you assume responsibility for an external event over which you have no control.

Example: “My daughter failed her exam. I should have done more to help her.”

Solution: How other adults behave is their responsibility.

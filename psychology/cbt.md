# Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
## What is Cognitive Therapy?
There are three principles at the core of CBT:
1. Your moods are created by your ‘cognitions’, or thoughts.

2. When you are feeling depressed, your thoughts are dominated by a pervasive negativity.

3. The negative thoughts which cause your emotional turmoil nearly always contain gross distortions.

## What are the gross distortions?
### 1. All or Nothing thinking
The tendency to think in terms of false dichotomies.
You're either on top of the world OR down in the depths of despair.

Example: "I got laid off. I'm a total loser".

Solution: There are no absolutes in life.

### 2. Over generalization
You conclude that one thing that's happened to you will continue to happen again and again.

Example: "Why does this always happen to me".

Solution: Stop saying "always", "every" and "never". Really never?

### 3. Mental Filter
Involves focusing entirely on the negative aspects of a situation while excluding the positive.

Example: After a good presentation someone gives a little bit of critical feedback.

Solution: Ask yourself "What's great about this problem?"

### 4. Disqualifying the Positive
Involves transforming all neutral or positive experiences into negative ones.
Example: After acing an interview you say: "Oh it was nothing really"

Solution: Cultivate an attitude of gratitude.

### 5. Jumping to Conclusions
You jump to negative conclusions with little or no evidence.

a) Mind Reading
You assume that you know what someone else is thinking.

Example: "She's gossiping about me. I know it!"

b) Fortune Telling
Tendency to arbitrarily predict the future negatively.

Example: "I just know I'm going to flunk my interview today"

### 6. Magnification (catastrophizing)
Occurs when you look at your own errors and exaggerate their importance.

Example: "I can't believe I said that. My life is over."

Solution: Be mindful of the language you use to describe events.

### 7. Minimization
You inappropriately shrink things like your own desirable qualities until they appear tiny.

Example: "I'm not that good at my life"

### 8. Emotional Reasoning
When we take our emotions as evidence for the truth.

Example: "I feel worthless, therefore I am worthless".

### 9. Should Statements
This is when you have ironclad rules for how you or others should behave.

Example: “People ought to call ahead when they’re running late.”

### 10. Labeling and Mislabeling
When you describe an event using words that are highly colored and emotionally charged.

Example: “I ate too much dessert. I feel like a disgusting pig.”

### 11. Personalization
Personalization occurs when you assume responsibility for an external event over which you have no control.

Example: “My daughter failed her exam. I should have done more to help her.”

Solution: How other adults behave is their responsibility.

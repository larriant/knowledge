# Developmental Psychology

What happened during an individual's childhood and fetal life that contributed to the behaviour?

# Adolesence
The final brain region to fully mature is the frontal cortex.

This doesn't go fully online until the midtwenties.

Two implications:
1. No part of the adult brain is more shaped by adolescence than the frontal cortex.

2. Nothing about adolescence can be understood outside the context of delayed frontocortical maturation.

Outcomes of immature frontal cortex:
+ more risk taking.
+ vulnerability to peer pressure from social groups.

# Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development

1. Sensorimotor stage (birth to ~24 months)

Thoughts only concern what the child can directly sense and explore.

Around 8 months they develop "object permanence". Understanding that even if they can't seen an object it still exists.

2. Preoperational stage (~2 years to 7 years)

The child can maintain ideas about how the world works without explicit examples in front of them.

Thoughts are increasingly symbolic. Imaginary play abounds.

## Kohlberg Stages of Moral Development

Should I eat the cooking?

### Level 1: Preconventional reasoning.

a) How likely am I to get punished? Being punished is unpleasant.

b) Will I get rewarded? Being rewarded is nice.

### Level 2: Conventional Reasoning

a) Who we be deprived? Do I like them? It's nice to think of others. It's good to be well regarded.

b) What's the law? What if everyone broke the law? It's nice to have order.

Most adolescents and adults are at this level.

### Level 3: postconventional Reasoning

a) What circumstances placed the cooking there? Who decided that I shouldn't take it? It's nice when clear rules are applied flexibly.

b) Is my moral stance regarding this more vital than some law? It's nice to know there are things for which I'd repeatedly sing "We will not be moved".

The rules and their application comes from within and reflect conscience.

A transgression exacts the ultimate cost --- having to live with yourself afterwards.

Being good and being law abiding aren't synonymous.

## Childhood

While little in childhood determines an adult behaviour, virtually everything in childhood changes propensities towards some adult behaviour.

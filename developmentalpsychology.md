# Developmental Psychology

What happens during an individual's childhood and fetal life that contributes to their behaviour?

# Adolesence
The final brain region to fully mature is the frontal cortex.

This doesn't go fully online until the midtwenties.

Two implications:
1. No part of the adult brain is more shaped by adolescence than the frontal cortex.

2. Nothing about adolescence can be understood outside the context of delayed frontocortical maturation.

Outcomes of immature frontal cortex:
+ more risk taking.
+ vulnerability to peer pressure from social groups.

# Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development

## 1. Sensorimotor stage (birth to ~24 months)

+ The infant knows the world through their movements and sensations.
+ Children learn about the world through basic actions such as sucking, grasping, looking, and listening.
+ Infants learn that things continue to exist even though they cannot be seen (object permanence).
+ They are separate beings from the people and objects around them.
+ They realize that their actions can cause things to happen in the world around them.

## 2. Preoperational stage (~2 to 7 years)

+ Children begin to think symbolically and learn to use words and pictures to represent objects.
+ Children at this stage tend to be egocentric and struggle to see things from the perspective of others.
+ While they are getting better with language and thinking, they still tend to think about things in very concrete terms.

## 3. Concrete Operational stage (7 to 11 years)

+ During this stage, children begin to thinking logically about concrete events.
+ They begin to understand the concept of conservation; that the amount of liquid in a short, wide cup is equal to that in a tall, skinny glass, for example.
+ Their thinking becomes more logical and organized, but still very concrete.
+ Children begin using inductive logic, or reasoning from specific information to a general principle.

## 4. Formal Operational stage (12 and up)

+ At this stage, the adolescent or young adult begins to think abstractly and reason about hypothetical problems.
+ Abstract thought emerges.
+ Teens begin to think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.
+ Begin to use deductive logic, or reasoning from a general principle to specific information.
    
# Kohlberg Stages of Moral Development

Should I eat the cooking?

### Level 1: Preconventional reasoning.

a) How likely am I to get punished? Being punished is unpleasant.

b) Will I get rewarded? Being rewarded is nice.

### Level 2: Conventional Reasoning

a) Who will be deprived? Do I like them? It's nice to think of others. It's good to be well regarded.

b) What's the law? What if everyone broke the law? It's nice to have order.

Most adolescents and adults are at this level.

### Level 3: postconventional Reasoning

a) What circumstances placed the cooking there? Who decided that I shouldn't take it? It's nice when clear rules are applied flexibly.

b) Is my moral stance regarding this more vital than some law? It's nice to know there are things for which I'd repeatedly sing "We will not be moved".

The rules and their application comes from within and reflect conscience.

A transgression exacts the ultimate cost --- having to live with yourself afterwards.

Being good and being law abiding aren't synonymous.

## Childhood

While little in childhood determines an adult behaviour, virtually everything in childhood changes propensities towards some adult behaviour.

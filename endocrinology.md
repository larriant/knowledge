# Endocrinology

## Introduction

Endocrinology is the study of **hormones.**

### What are hormones?

Hormones:

* are released from glands.
* enter the bloodstream.
* can influence cells throughout the body.

Hormonal effects emerge over **hours to days**. \(And can persist forever.\)

### What can hormones do?

Hormones can:

* change the activity of particular proteins.
* turn certain genes on or off.
* alter the metabolism of cells.
* cause cells to grow or atrophy.
* cause cells to divide or shrivel up and die.

Hormones are extremely versatile.

### The Neuroendocrine Axis

1. Limbic system stimulates the hypothalamus.
2. Hypothalamus secretes a particular hormone that travels to the pituitary. \(just below base of brain\)
3. This stimulates the secretion of a particular pituitary hormone.
4. This hormone enters circulation and stimulates the secretion of a third hormone from some peripheral gland.

### Hormone Receptors

There is a distinctive receptor molecule of reach type of hormone. 

Their shape is complementary to the shape of the hormone.

The hormone fits into its receptor like a key fits into a lock.

#### Change

A hormone receptors "avidity" for its hormone can change.

The number of receptors for a particular hormone in a cell can change.

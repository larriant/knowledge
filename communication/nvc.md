# Non Violent Communication
The fundamental idea of NVC is that human conflict comes from unfulfilled needs. 

These needs cause feelings and thoughts which then lead to violent communication.

Needs -> Feelings / Thoughts -> Violent Communication

The solution to these “violent” modes of communication is to better understand our own needs and those of others.

NVC teaches 3 methods for achieving this:

## 1. Self - Empathy

* What are the needs that underlie the thoughts and emotions we are feeling?

* We can’t adequately express our needs without knowing what they are.

## 2. Receiving Empathetically

NVC suggests that we should try and listen for the underlying feelings, needs and requests people are making whether they come in a “violent” form or not.

## 3. Expressing Honestly

When we feel we have an unfulfilled need that we want to express NVC has a 4 step process for doing this.

### a) Express an observation. (specific to time and content) Don’t generalise.

Don’t say: You never listen to me. 
Say: You didn’t seem to be listening to me when I was telling you about my troubles at work.

### b) Explain how you are feeling in relation to what you observe.

Don’t say: It makes me think that you don’t love me. 
Say: It makes me feel unloved.

### c) Explain what you need or value (rather than a preference) that causes your feelings.

Say: I need re-assurance and love in my life.

### d) Request the concrete actions I would like taken.
Say: Would you be willing to try to pay more attention to me next time I’m trying to get stuff off my chest?

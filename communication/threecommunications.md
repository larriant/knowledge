# Three Simultaneous Communications

Idea that in any given conversation with friction in it, there’s actually three conversations happening. 

## 1. The “What Happened?” Conversation. 
Most difficult conversations involve disagreement about what has happened or what should happen. 

* Who said what and who did what? 
* Who’s right, who meant what, and who’s to blame?

## 2. The Feelings Conversation.
Every difficult conversation also asks and answers questions about feelings.

* Are my feelings valid? Appropriate? 
* Should I acknowledge or deny them, put them on the table or check them at the door? 
* What do I do about the other person’s feelings?

## 3. The Identity Conversation
This is the conversation we each have with ourselves about what this situation means to us.

We conduct an internal debate over whether this means we are competent or incompetent, a good person or bad, worthy of love or unlovable. 

What impact might it have on our self-image and self-esteem, our future and our well-being? 

Our answers to these questions determine in large whether we feel “balanced” during the conversation, or whether we feel off-center and anxious.””


## Example
For instance, if a manager at a company felt like an employee was writing poor-quality memos and recommended the employee take a course on business writing, it might look like this.

1. What Happened: the manager assessed the employee’s writing was poor and recommended a writing course. The employee might or might not agree their writing was poor.

2. Feelings: the manager might be a mix of frustrated but also excited to see the employee’s development. The employee might feel, simultaneously, like their manager doesn’t care about them and feels insulted by it.

3. Identity: the manager might not even think about this level, assessing the writing quality as just a professional skill to improve and not a big deal. The employee might see it as a display they’re not competent or stupid.

# Decisions

This is a guide to making good decisions.

## What makes us make bad decisions?
To know how to make good decisions we first have to figure out what makes them bad.

### 1. Narrow Framing
Often we fail to evaluate options outside a narrow range.

For example:
* ¨Should I quit my job or not¨ (single binary choice)

### 2. Confirmation Bias
We look for evidence to support a pre-existing belief.

For example:
* ¨Should I buy this fancy gadget?¨


### 3. Short-Term Emotion
We overweight short term emotions over long term emotions. 
* Short Term Emotions lead to Short Term Thinking

For example:
* ¨Should I ask this person out? It´s so scary!¨

### 4. Overconfidence
We assume that we know more than we actually do know and jump to conclusions, thinking we can accurately predict the future.


For example:
* Television won´t be able to hold onto any market it captures after the first six months. 
* People will get tired at looking at a plywood box every night.

## WRAP Process for Better Decisions
1. Widen Your Options
  + Look out for ´whether or not questions´. There are never only two options.
  + Consider Opportunity Costs
    + ´Should I buy the 1000 dollar stereo or the 700 dollar stereo´. Instead ´700 dollar stereo AND 300 dollars of CDs´
  + Vanishing Options Genie - Appears and declares that if you choose any of the current options in will make your head explode!
  + Multi-Track - Explore multiple options in parallel. This AND that. Rather than This OR that.
  + ´Prevention Focus´ vs `Promotion Focus´ - Leads to focus on reducing cons or pursuing pros respectively.
  + Look for Bright Spots - People, places or practices that are already successful. And figure out how to replicate them.
    + e.g. Instead of asking: ´How do we fix malnutrition in poor villages´, Ask: ´Which villages are not suffering from nutrition and what are they doing differently?"
  + Ladder Up - Look for solutions to similar problems.
    + For example (Trying to solve the problem of waiting times in school cafeteria): How do other business handle lines?, How are large crowds handled in general? , How are other flow problems handled?

2. Reality test your assumptions
  + Seek out Disagreement.
    + Create a Murder Board - Used to aggressively review a decision.
  + What would have to be true for this to be the correct answer?
  + What evidence would persuade me to change my mind?
  + Refocus the conversation from competing sides to facts that can be researched
  + Consider both the inside and the outside view.
    + e.g. You might naively think your chances of business success are 50%. But 99% of similar startups fail.
    + Seek out multiple independent points of view. Find someone with more experience that you. And ask for a base rate.
  + 'Ooch' - Find cheap, fast ways to test theories and get feedback.

3. Attain Distance Before Deciding
  + 10/10/10 - How will you feel about this decision 10 minutes from now, 10 months from now and 10 years from now.
    + e.g. Asking someone out. In 10 minutes: Happy or Embarrassed. In 10 months: In a relationship or forgotten. In 10 years: Married or Forgotten.
  + Bundling Habits - What will my life be like if I habitually take these leaps?
    + e.g. ´Should I sleep in today?´ vs ´Should I sleep in for the rest of my life´
  + Look at the Worst Case Outcome and Imagine how you would respond.
  + What would our successors do? What would I advise my best friend?

4. Prepare to be Wrong
  + Mental Simulation - Imagine different scenarios and how you would respond.
  + Pre-mortem - Imagine the event has already happened and failed horribly. Why?
  + Pre-parade - Imagine the event has already happened and succeeded wonderfully. Why? Would this bring problems of it´s own?
  + Vaccinate against disappointment

### When to make decisions?
Sometimes you fail to realise that there is a decision to be made.

For example:
* You spend 30 years in a job that's "just okay" because you decide to change.

To solve this problem you can set __Trip Wires__. 
These are times in the future when you will make a decision.

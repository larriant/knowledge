# Decisions

This is a guide to making good decisions.

## Why do we make bad decisions?

### 1. Narrow Framing

We fail to evaluate options outside a narrow range.

For example:

* ¨Should I quit my job or not¨ \(single binary choice\)

### 2. Confirmation Bias

We look for evidence to support a pre-existing belief.

For example:

* ¨Should I buy this fancy gadget?¨

### 3. Short-Term Emotion

We overweight short term emotions over long term emotions.

* Short Term Emotions lead to Short Term Thinking

For example:

* ¨Should I ask this person out? It´s so scary!¨

### 4. Overconfidence

We think we know more than we actually do know and jump to conclusions. We assume we can accurately predict the future.

For example:

* Television won´t be able to hold onto any market it captures after the first six months. 
* People will get tired at looking at a plywood box every night.

## Techniques for Better Decisions

Uses the Acronym **WRAP** 

### 1. \***W\***iden Your Options

* Look out for ´whether or not questions´. There are never only two options.
* Consider Opportunity Costs
  * ´Should I buy the 1000 dollar stereo or the 700 dollar stereo´. Instead ´700 dollar stereo AND 300 dollars of CDs´
* Vanishing Options Genie - Appears and declares that if you choose any of the current options in will make your head explode!
* Multi-Track - Explore multiple options in parallel. This AND that. Rather than This OR that.
* ´Prevention Focus´ vs \`Promotion Focus´ - Leads to focus on reducing cons or pursuing pros respectively.
* Look for Bright Spots - People, places or practices that are already successful. And figure out how to replicate them.
  * e.g. Instead of asking: ´How do we fix malnutrition in poor villages´, Ask: ´Which villages are not suffering from nutrition and what are they doing differently?"
* Ladder Up - Look for solutions to similar problems.
  * For example \(Trying to solve the problem of waiting times in school cafeteria\): How do other business handle lines?, How are large crowds handled in general? , How are other flow problems handled?

### 2. \***R\***eality test your assumptions

* Seek out Disagreement.
  * Create a Murder Board - Used to aggressively review a decision.
* What would have to be true for this to be the correct answer?
* What evidence would persuade me to change my mind?
* Refocus the conversation from competing sides to facts that can be researched
* Consider both the inside and the outside view.
  * e.g. You might naively think your chances of business success are 50%. But 99% of similar startups fail.
  * Seek out multiple independent points of view. Find someone with more experience that you. And ask for a base rate.
* 'Ooch' - Find cheap, fast ways to test theories and get feedback.

### 3. \***A\***ttain Distance Before Deciding

* 10/10/10 - How will you feel about this decision 10 minutes from now, 10 months from now and 10 years from now.
  * e.g. Asking someone out. In 10 minutes: Happy or Embarrassed. In 10 months: In a relationship or forgotten. In 10 years: Married or Forgotten.
* Bundling Habits - What will my life be like if I habitually take these leaps?
  * e.g. ´Should I sleep in today?´ vs ´Should I sleep in for the rest of my life´
* Look at the Worst Case Outcome and Imagine how you would respond.
* What would our successors do? What would I advise my best friend?

### 4. \***P\***repare to be Wrong

* Mental Simulation - Imagine different scenarios and how you would respond.
* Pre-mortem - Imagine the event has already happened and failed horribly. Why?
* Pre-parade - Imagine the event has already happened and succeeded wonderfully. Why? Would this bring problems of it´s own?
* Vaccinate against disappointment

### When to make decisions?

Sometimes you fail to realise that there is a decision to be made.

For example:

* You spend 30 years in a job that's "just okay" because you decide to change.

To solve this problem you can set **Trip Wires**.   
These are times in the future when you will make a decision.

# Finances

These are the simple rules I will stick to to help keep my expenditure down.

1. Have a fixed amount of discretionary spending. At the moment: Â£10 per day.
2. Put this money on a pre-paid card.
3. Other expenditures i.e. accommodation / travel / standing orders just move money into best account to pay it.

# Planning
Humans are really bad at planning.

We fall victim to the *planning fallacy*.

This is the tendancy to make unrealistic predictions and plans that just don't work out.
* Only 30% of people finish on-time, even when they're assuming the worst-case scenario.
* The Scottish Parliament Building cost *10* times more than expected.

What's going on in our heads when we make these aweful predictions?
* We only use the *inside view* which is information about the specific project.
* The *outside view* is what someone else would say looking at your project.

## Planning Techniques
### Murphyjitsu
This is a strategy to: "Avoid Obvious Failures".

Murphyjistu involves a strategy called a "premortem" where you imagine that a project has already failed and look backwards to see what went wrong.

#### The Steps
1) Figure out your goal. This is the thing you want to make plans to do.

2) Write down the specific things you need to get done to make the thing happen
+ make a list!

3) Imagine it's one week (or month) later, and yet you somehow didn't manage to get started on your goal.
+ are you surprised?

4) Why? (What went wrong that got in your way?)

5) Now imagine you take steps to remove obstacles from Step 4.

6) Return to Step 3. Are you still surprised that you'd fail. If so, your plan is probably good enough.

7) If failure still seems likely, go through steps 3-6 a few more times until you "problem proof" your plan.

#### Example
(Step 1) My Goal: Exercise every day. 
(Step 2) More specific: go running on odd days. Strength on even.
(Step 3) If I didn't go exercising what went wrong? Forgot to remind myself!
(Step 4) What if I set phone/email reminders?
(Step 5) Is that good enough? Would I be surprised to fail?

Rinse and repeat.

### Reference Class Forecasting
This is a strategy to: "Get Accurate Estimates"

It is all about using the outside view.

We tend to see all the ways that things can go right.
But none of the ways that things can go wrong.

By looking at past history - other people who have tried the same thing as us - we can get a better idea of how long things will really take.

# Steps
1. Figure out what you want to do.

2. See your records for how long it took you last time.

3. That's your new prediction.

4. If you don't have past information, look for how long it takes on average to do your thing.

5. That's your new prediction!

### Back Planning
Technique to: "Calibrate your intuitions with reality"

Instead of thinking about where we start and how to move forwards.
Imagine we are already at our goal and go backwards.

## Steps
1. Figure out the task you want to get done.

2. Imagine you're at the end of your task.

3. Now move backwards, step-by-step. What is the step right before you finish?

4. Repeat Step 3 until you get to where you are now.

5. Write down how long you think the task will now take you.

6. You now have a detailed plan as well as a better prediction.

Because backplanning is a weird, counter-intuitive way to think about things, it disrupts a lot of mental processes that can lead to overconfidence.

## Example
(Step 1) I want to host a talk at my school.
(Step 2) The end goal is finishing the talk and taking questions.
(Step 3) Well people would need to be actually in the room. And I would have needed a room.
(Step 3) For people to show up I would have needed publicity.
(Step 3) For the actual talk I would need slides. And need to memorize the talk.
(Step 3) Also would need to figure out what my talk is actually going to be on.
(Step 4) Now I can actually predict how long this will take: 3 weeks!

# Diet

These are the rules that I try to stick to:

1. Never buy meat (red meat, poultry, seafood and the flesh of any animal).
2. Never buy processed / sugary food (except dark chocolate). (includes crisps and sugary drinks)
3. Avoid buying milk, eggs, cheese and other animal products.
4. Take Vitamin D & Vitamin B12 every morning.
5. Drink water, tea and coffee for thirst.  Max 1 coffee pd.
6. Eat as much real food as possible. And as many beans, pushes and nuts.
7. Avoid alcohol and hard drugs (like opiates)

I say ‘Never buy’ because I like to flexible. If someone can’t finish their meal. Or there’s some left over pepperoni pizza I will eat it.

I saw ‘Avoid’ dairy products because often you don’t want to check that everything is vegan. Where I can I buy vegan. But I don’t want it to be a constant drain on my life.

# Habits

## What are habits?

### The Standard Habit Model

\[Context Cue\] -&gt; \[Response\]

* The Context Cue is the external thing in the environment that triggers a habit.
* The Response is the behaviour that follows the cue.

### Why are habits great?

Habits are:

1. Insensitive to Reward Changes
   1. if you alter or remove rewards then the habits persist.

2. Independent of Intentions
   1. As habits get stronger and stronger intentions matter less and less.

3. Automatic Defaults
   1. They operate without much conscious control.

### Habit Statistics

* The average time to form a habit is: _66 days_
* At least _40%_ of your everyday activities are habitual.

## Techniques for _making_ habits

### 1. TAPs \(Trigger Action Plans\)

They are "if-then" rules used for behaviour modification.

"I intend to do action X when I encounter situation Y".

TAPs work because they help us notice situations were we could carry out our intentions.

#### Walkthrough

1. Identify an Action you want to do.
   1. i.e. "Go Jogging More"

2. Find a concrete sensory Rrigger for the situation where you want the action to happen.
   1. i.e. The feeling of the coarse rope that opens my curtains in the morning.

3. Describe the Action you'd like to perform, in detail. Be specific!
   1. "Pick up my jogging shoes and walk outside the door to begin jogging"

4. Put the Trigger and Action in a "When \[Trigger\], then \[Action\]" loop.
   1. When I \[feel the coarse rope of my curtains\], then I'll \[go grab my jogging shoes and start jogging\]

5. Write down the TAP somewhere you can find it again.
   1. Having a digital or physical "TAPs document" can help make it easy to review which habits you are training.

6. Mentally rehearse the TAP at least 5 times.
   1. Actually take the several minutes to do some visualisations.

#### Good TAPs

A good TAP fulfills three requirements:

1. The trigger is clear.  
   i. The "when" part is a specific, visible thing that's easy to notice.

2. The trigger is consistent.  
   i. The action is something that you'll always want to do when the trigger is fulfilled.

3. The TAP furthers your goals.  
   i. Make sure the TAP is actually useful!

#### When to trigger TAPS

* Good places to insert TAPS are at the ends of exiting routines.
* TAPs can themselves be the trigger for future TAPs.

### 2. Systematic Planning

How do I make sure I actually use my TAPs?

#### Active Monitoring.

This simply meanings staying aware of the progress you're making \(or not\) on your habits.

You should set a time to review your TAPs.

Here is a sample set of questions?

1. What is the TAP you are trying to learn?
2. Did you do it sometime in the last week? Write down at least 1 example situation.
3. What are 3 examples where the Trigger might come up?
4. Visualize yourself doing the Action 3 times.
5. Repeat these questions for each TAP on your TAPs list.

Active Monitoring as a TAP  
Trigger: "After I finish eating breakfast"  
Action: "Then I will immediately go fill out my Active Monitoring worksheet."

#### TAP Everything

We need to develop a TAP designed to look for new opportunities to make TAPs.

You meet someone who opens up with a very nice conversation starter.  
Make a TAP out of it!  
\[Next time I meet a stranger\] =&gt; \[Say those words\]

A "TAP everything" meta-TAP might look like  
Trigger: "When I notice myself thinking 'I want to do X'"  
Action: "Look for a specific Trigger to do X and turn it into a TAP."

#### \[\[Murphyjitsu\]\] your TAPs

A Murphyjitsu your TAPs meta-TAP:  
Trigger: "When I think of of a new TAP"  
Action: "I will imagine that it's one week later and I haven't done my TAP at all. What are the first two failures to come to mind"?

The end goal here would be to chunk the two meta-TAPs together. So they form a cached sequence.

### 3. Scaling Up

The intention-action gap is where we fail to take action despite holding the intention to do so.

Scaling up is a technique designed to bridge this gap.

Good to differentiate between two reasons why a habit might not stick:  
1. You forget about the action when the opportunity comes.  
2. You _don't want_ to do the action when the opportunity comes.

Start small and build up.

Initiate with a watered down, doable version of the activity. And gradually scale up.

_Shaping_ is the idea of gradually rewarding behaviour that gets closer and closer to the target.

_Exposure Therapy_ is a process of being consistently exposed to aversive phenomenon leading to a decrease in the feelings of aversion.

Step-by-step:  
1. Quantify the aversive Action you would like to be able to do.

* Ever day, right after taking a shower, I want to write 1000 words.
  1. Find a smaller version of the Action you can take without much resistance.
* Every day I will write 200 words!
  1. Scale up gradually and consistently.
* Every week I will add 100 more words to my daily writing goal.

## Techniques for _Breaking_ habits

### 1. Going Upstream

This attempts to remove the context cues of unwanted habits beforehand so the habit doesn't activate.

We know that habits fire in the presence of certain context cues.  
Many of these cues are in the environment.

One example.  
When you open your FB newsfeed.  
You often spend a long bout of time distracted.  
So to _Go Upstream_ you could disable your FB newsfeed.

Going upstream is very similar to the idea of precommitment.  
Which is the idea of cutitng off some of your options ahead of time.  
For example throwing out all unhealthy snacks in the house.

#### Trigger Removal

Remove the Trigger that leads to the habit.

The steps:  
1. Put your unwanted habit into the TAP framework.

* "You want to stop checking your phone for notifications"

* Identify the Trigger\(s\) that seem to lead you towards taking the Action.

* "You realize it's the ping soung of notifications that is the trigger"

* Take steps to remove the Trigger from your environment.

* You silence your phone's notifications.

#### Cue Disruption

This is the most extreme verison of Trigger Removal.

Certain windows of opportunity make it a lot easier to Go Upstream and alter cues.

Specifically these opportunities are major shifts in your environment.

When people move to a new, unfamiliar place, this is the prime time to form new habits and break old ones.

There's not much to it:  
1. Undergo a change in your environment.

* Move to a new city.
  1. Form new TAPs using the new environmental cues.
* Stop eating junk food because you don't know where the unhealthy restaurants are.

#### Changing Friction

Not all triggers are external environmental ones.  
They might involve feelings or emotions.  
Or they might be something you have no direct control over. Like what words other people say.

When you don't have complete control over the Trigger.  
The next beest thing you can do is to make it _harder_ for you to access either the Trigger or the Action.

"Friction" here means additional barriers to immediate access.

An example of Reducing Friction would be if someone wanted to go to the gym everyday.  
So they asked a good friend to bring gym clothes for them and pick them up.

Steps:  
1. Identify the TAP you'd like to affect.

* You have a bad internet browsing habit that eats up a lot of time.
* \[Feel tired and not engaged\] -&gt; \[Go on a browsing spiral\].

* Look at the Trigger. Find a way to make it easier or harder to encounter.

* How can I change the frequency with which I encounter this Trigger.

* Look at the Action. Finc a way to make it easier or harder to take.

* You could block the sites that you commonly go on.

### 2. Substitution

This is where you swap out one action for another but keep the same trigger.

The aim is to switch out your defaults with better responses.

One problem when trying to break unwanted habits is that merely trying to "not do it" is largely ineffective.

1. Identify the TAP you'd like to change, specifically the Trigger.
   * You'd like to drink less soda. You typically think of getting sodas after ordering a burger.
2. Find an alternative action to replace it with that's more satisfactory.
   * You decide to ask for an ice water instead.
3. Do 5 mental run-throughs of the updated TAP and keep track of your progress with tools from Systematic Planning.

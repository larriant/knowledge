# Neurons
3 major parts:

The dendrites: they get signals from other neurons.

These signals can be wither excitory or inhibitory.
Excitory raise the likelihood that the neuron will fire.
Inhibitory lowers the likelihood.

The axon:

The myelin sheef.

There are a thousand, billion neurons.

Each neuron can be connected to thousands of other neurons.

There are sensory neurons that take information from the world.

There are motor neurons that tell the muscles what to do.

There are inter neurons do the thinking. They make the connection between sensation and action.

A Neuron is like a gun. It either fires or it doesn't.

Number of neurons firing = intensity.

## Neuro-Transmitters

Alcohol inhibits the inhibitory parts of your brain. 
Amphetamines increase the amount of arousal.
Prozac works on serotonin.
Parkinson's disease is too little dopamine.


The brain works through parallel processing.
